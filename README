This is a command line application that reads a text clipping file in mac OS X.

You can also use these following flags along with the file:
-v			Verbose
--plain		Plain text

In the future I may add support for more types of text, if I can find any.  For now this depends on the textClipping containing either plain text, or rtf.  The --plain option just reads the plain text part of the clipping.

NOTE: Despite the copyright, you can copy this, and use it in any way you want.
